We haven't used any fairness metrics either, but we can already see a few points that are warning signs. The first one is that the average success rate within the training data differs for various ethnicities (Asian : 0.34, Black : 0.36, Hispanic : 0.39 , White : 0.41). If there was no proxies at all for ethnicity in the data, it would be fine to train with this data as ethnicity would have zero influence on the result. Unfortunately, we have seen that it is not the case. We can therefore expect there might be some bias on a model trained on this data. \n",
